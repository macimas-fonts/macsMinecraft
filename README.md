this is most likely what you're looking for! it should cover almost every character in respect to Minecraft Java 1.20.4

a little experiment. i dont really like most of it turned out. i may add more and polish this up in later versions, but for now it just exists `:p`

	please note that some characters aren't built properly due to the converter i use. it does provide a fix but filesize triples and im too stubborn, so yeah. i dont realy care for now since you probably dont really need to use this package anyway

## license
fonts are under [SIL Open Font License](./LICENSE)

feel free and open source to use these fonts freely, for personal and commercial purposes! `:D`


## how to build?
uhmmm not sure why you need to do that but here's some prerequisites:

- Linux (sorry...)
- other things (`lua`, `fontforge`, `findutils`, `zip`)

then run the script `lua generate.lua`

it should generate fonts in `temp/`, and zip those fonts into their respective packages in `build/`


## some boring background info

i started this back in around December 2022 when i couldn't find a nice Minecraft font. they were either not pixel-perfect, outdated, or were quite lacking or weird looking

initial attempt only contained Basic Latin and some other characters i needed. was pretty satisfied with it and kept it as is for an entire year, until i revisited the font in December 2023

was pretty bored in christmas break and thought "wat if i make a mc font that's 1:1 used ingame for funsies"

"no way in hell i'm gonna be able to do that" i said, but tried anyway, making this my most ambitious font recreation yet

also this was previously released as "mdt's Minecraft" only on github, but decided to rename it and release it as separate font for terrible reasons `:v` the previous version is still up in my fonts repo, but i'd rather not you find it `>:(`
