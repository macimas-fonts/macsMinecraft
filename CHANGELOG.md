<hr>

this font was previously released as "mdt's Minecraft", but for stupid reasons decided to rename it and made it as a separate font

here's changelog between main 1.0 and mdt's 1.1:

- add Gothic block and other characters `❄ 🎣 🛡`
- fix some characters `@ ─ ╫ ´ ƞ Ҧ ҧ Ӂ ӝ Ӡ ԭ Ὶ Ί ῠ ῡ ῢ ΰ ῤ ῥ ῦ ῧ Ῠ Ῡ Ὺ Ύ Ῥ ῲ ῳ ῴ ῶ ῷ Ὸ Ό Ὼ Ώ ῼ`
	- `@` wasn't in the font due to oversight

and here's changelog from the previous font:

# mdt's 1.1 (December 23, 2023)
- should now cover entire Basic Multilingual Plane
- fixed some symbols not being 1:1 `₃ ⅞ ⅟ ↉`
- adds `✗` (i missed it previously)

# mdt's 1.0 (December 21, 2023)
- initial release. should cover most of Basic Multilingual Plane + some mix of symbols. has 2,271 symbols :)
